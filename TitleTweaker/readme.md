**TitleTweaker** is an intuitive tool which allows your users to easily refine their post titles easily.

Users can submit their revised title through a simple form, and the bot reposts it for them.

**Instructions**:

* ![Enter new title in the repost form](image-1.png)

* ![That's it, just refresh the feed!](image-2.png)
