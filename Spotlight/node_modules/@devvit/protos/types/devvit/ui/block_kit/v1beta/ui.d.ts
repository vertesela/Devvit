/**
 * This file encodes a generic protocol for rendering UIs.  If you want to embed a UI into Devvit, you should use this protocol.
 * This protobuf is for the second iteration of Blocks components.  It's an extraction of CustomPost to work with any UI surface.
 *
 * The idea is that if you want to add a new surface, you can add an rpc method that takes a RenderUIRequest and returns a RenderUIResponse.
 * This RPC method will encompass the full lifecycle of the UI.  It will be called when the UI is first rendered, and it will be called again
 * when the user or system interacts with the UI via UIEvents.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *    service MyService {
 *      rpc MyNewSidebarUI(UIRequest) returns (UIResponse) {};
 *    }
 *
 * There are some optimizations encoded in the protocol.  For example, if you just want a pure render, you can send a UIRequest with no events.  This
 * will return a UIResponse with no effects and no new state.  Conversely, if you want to update state, but not render anything, you can send a UIRequest
 * with no_render set to true.  This will return a UIResponse with effects and state updates but no new UI.
 *
 * The common case, however, is to send a UIRequest with events and no_render set to false.  This will perform the state updates, do a render, then return
 * a UIResponse with a new UI, new state, and effects, and saving the multiple round-trips.
