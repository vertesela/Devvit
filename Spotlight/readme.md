Do you moderate a subreddit where the company account occasionally comment, but the company account is not a moderator?

Have you ever wanted to pin someone else's comment to the top of a thread for whatever reason, but couldn't?

**Spotlight** is an app that allows mods and some approved users to pin someone else's comment pinned in a thread.

**So, Spotlight can:**

• pin comments from other users - mods and approved users only

• delete content created by the app - mods only


**Instructions**

* **Approved users & mods**

First, moderators who have an access to [Dev Platform](https://preview.redd.it/introducing-spotlight-an-app-that-allows-op-and-approved-v0-k59jfz5j5omd1.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=91982f87f69e517712b55cc510f1b5da1f092d5e) should go to the app settings and add some legit users who will be able to use this option (mostly official accounts and popular subreddit helpers, but it's up to mods).


If you want to pin someone else's comment, just go to that comment and select [Spotlight](https://preview.redd.it/introducing-spotlight-an-app-that-allows-op-and-approved-v0-1bgn1qmd7omd1.png?width=737&format=png&auto=webp&s=19586ddeb2de37cb0759ca1c5feb99201ff4af24)


After that, you'll need to write something in the [Devvit form](https://preview.redd.it/introducing-spotlight-an-app-that-allows-op-and-approved-v0-1bgn1qmd7omd1.png?width=737&format=png&auto=webp&s=19586ddeb2de37cb0759ca1c5feb99201ff4af24). When you are done, just press OK.

[And, that's it! If you'd like to delete this comment, ask mods.](https://preview.redd.it/introducing-spotlight-an-app-that-allows-op-and-approved-v0-b6m45nch6omd1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=825d00617184b1c9ae6a1424a1304882b15e4442)

* **Mods only**

If you want to delete a comment by u/spotlight-app, simply go to that comment, go to mod option and select [Spotlight] - [Delete content](https://preview.redd.it/introducing-spotlight-an-app-that-allows-op-and-approved-v0-tb0j7muw6omd1.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=651d0869ec516f8639392c06feb17805f77492e6) and the comment will be deleted.
