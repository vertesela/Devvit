# ðŸŒŸ Spotlight â€“ Pin important comments on Reddit (even if theyâ€™re not yours)

Do you moderate a subreddit where a company, organization, or trusted user sometimes comments â€” but they arenâ€™t a mod?

Ever wanted to pin someone elseâ€™s comment to the top of a thread, but couldnâ€™t?

**Spotlight** is an app that allows mods and approved users to **pin someone else's comment** to the top of a post â€” directly and visibly.

---

## âœ… What Spotlight can do?

- **Pin comments** from other users â€“ only mods and approved users can do this  
- **Delete content** created by the app â€“ mods only  
- **Automatically change the post flair** when a comment is spotlighted

## ðŸ”§ Instructions

### ðŸ‘¥ Approved Users & Mods

1. Moderators should go to the [Dev Platform settings](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/spotlight-app) and add some users who will be allowed to spotlight comments.  
   *(e.g. verified accounts, popular helpers â€“ up to the mods)*

2. To pin a comment:
   - Click the comment you want to spotlight  
   - Select the **Spotlight** option  
   - Fill in the form that appears (via Devvit UI), then click OK

3. Thatâ€™s it! The spotlighted comment will appear pinned directly under the post.

### Flair Feature (optional)

You can now set a **custom flair** that will automatically be applied to the post once a comment is spotlighted.

#### Example:
`Context Provided â€“ Spotlight`

- This helps alert readers that important context has been added.
- You can enable this feature and set your custom flair in the appâ€™s settings.
