/**
 * A map from the local file path of a media asset ("assets/file.png"), to either:
 * - If the relevant app version has finished uploading all its assets: its
 *     publicly accessible URL (https://i.redd.it/<ID>.png)
 * - If the relevant app version has not uploaded all its assets, or this is
 *     from the CLI which doesn't know the public URLs for any assets: the
 *     asset ID for the file as saved in dev-portal (NOT the media service ID).
 *     UUIDv4.
 * Note that this may be `undefined` if the bundle is old and/or there are no
 * assets associated with the app.
