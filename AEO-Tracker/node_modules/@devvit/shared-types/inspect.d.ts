 * Similar to node's standard util.inspect, with the following differences:
 * - Strings are not escaped (for example, when they have quote marks in them)
 *   and not enclosed in quotes
 * - Symbol keys in objects are dropped and not printed
 * - Prints arrays with more items per line sometimes
 * - Errors may include a stacktrace
 * - Promises are terse
 * - There's no color output
